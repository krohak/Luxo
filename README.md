## Inspiration
Inspiration #1 - [Luxo Jr](https://www.pixar.com/luxo-jr/)
We drew inspiration from Pixar's famous short film, Luxo Jr. We were majorly inspired by the ability of the inanimate objects to portray emotions through their movements and gestures. Additionally, we found a lot of 3D models of Luxo Jr. on the internet. As they are mostly open-source projects, we could modify these designs to model our lamp.

Inspiration #2 - [Peeqo](https://peeqo.com/)
Our second source of inspiration is Peeqo, a voice activated desktop companion that responds entirely through GIFs. It is a quirky personal assistant with a lot of personality, and can be customized in many ways to ensure productivity and entertainment. Setting timers & scheduling tasks by voice and keeping track of productivity of the user is handled by the open source code base of Peeqo, and combining that with the unique animatronics of Luxo Jr. would deliver a highly entertaining and efficient voice based personal assistant.
